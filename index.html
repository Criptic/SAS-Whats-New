    <h1>Unofficial SAS What's New</h1>
    <p>
      This small site tries to make all of the SAS Viya updates easier to search
      and filter and unite all upates in one place. All content displayed here
      is based on the What's New section of the SAS documentation and
      <a href="https://release-notes.sas.com/?locale=en"
        >Release Notes application</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source code for this application including all examples can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/Criptic/SAS-Whats-New">in this Repository</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Example do not link to documentation, but rather links to
      files directly that are stored in the source repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is meant as a compliment to my YouTube series
      <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLncvHGGelzhX1hMwfEHA2eBQOFgV1FfSZ"
        >Into the Viya Verse</a
      >
      which tackles only the highlights.
    </p>
    <h2>What this document covers</h2>
    <p>
      As there are many SAS products and solutions, I have chosen to concentrate
      on SAS Viya Enterprise. Sometimes I will also make note of SAS Solution
      specific release highlights, but only if I happen across that feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      This application was started with SAS Viya 2023.04, it does not contain
      any information on prior releases.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that not all entries contain links to examples.</p>
