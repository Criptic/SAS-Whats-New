# Unofficial SAS What's New

This small site tries to make all of the SAS Viya updates easier to search and filter and unite all updates in one place. All content displayed here is based on the What's New section of the SAS documentation and [Release Notes application](https://release-notes.sas.com/?locale=en).

In this repository you will find all the source of this application + all of the examples and utility scripts that I have created along the way.

Some of the example links do not link to documentation, but rather link to examples that are stored in the source GitHub repository of this page.

This page is meant as a compliment to my YouTube series [Into the Viya Verse](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLncvHGGelzhX1hMwfEHA2eBQOFgV1FfSZ) which tackles only the highlights.

## What this document covers

As there are many SAS products and solutions, I have chosen to concentrate on SAS Viya Enterprise. Sometimes I will also make note of SAS Solution specific release highlights, but only if I happen across that feature.

This application was started with SAS Viya 2023.04, it does not contain any information on prior releases.

You can access **examples** and **documentation** deep links by double clicking entries. Please note that not all entries contain links to examples - some just link to the documentation. You can also **sort** the document by either clicking the column headers or by right clicking the table and selecting sort.
