## New Editing Capabilities for Source Tables

You can perform actions such as applying filters, adding and deleting columns, editing individual data values, and adding and deleting rows. You can save your changes if you have Write permissions for the location.

## Enhanced Precision Containers

These enhancements are made when you are editing a report.

When you move the cursor over an object that is not selected, corner brackets appear. The corner brackets indicate the borders of the object.

If you select an object that is in the background, then it is temporarily moved to the front so that all of its contents are visible and available to interact with.

## Enhanced Geo Region and Geo Region-Coordinate Map

For geo region maps and geo region-coordinate maps, a new option enables you to display placeholder regions for regions that are not represented in the data. Placeholder regions can provide additional context for your map.
