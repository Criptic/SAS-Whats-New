# SAS Visual Analytics Enhancements in SAS Viya 2024.09

This small visual demonstration is built off of the SAS Visual Analytics What's New section for SAS Viya 2024.09 - find the source information [here](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/vacdc/v_028/vawn/n1tk86zu2bnpccn15ay2vb1wnrky.htm).

## Text Topic only Documents

In text topics objects, only documents that are part of a topic are displayed. Hiding the documents that are not part of the analysis makes text topics more consistent with the other analytical objects in SAS Visual Analytics.
