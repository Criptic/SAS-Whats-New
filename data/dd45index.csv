"If you are an administrator, you can remove quarantined files from the SAS Content and My Folder folders on the home page."
"If you are deploying on Red Hat OpenShift using a mirror registry, you should add a reference to a new file in the base kustomization.yaml file ($deploy/kustomization.yaml)."
"If you are using SingleStore data, you can now use a surrogate key that is generated elsewhere, or you can generate the surrogate key in SAS Studio"
"If your model has a continuous variable included in spline effects or in high-order effects, a new plot that shows the odds ratios across the range of the continuous variable is now produced when you specify it in an ODDSRATIO statement"
"Image Processing Enables Numeric Variables in Output"
"IMASE is the mean absolute error (MAE) of the forecast values, which is computed by scaling the error on the basis of the in-sample MAE from the one-step-ahead naive (random walk) forecast method"
"IML Action now supports the INTERP1 function."
"IML Proc now supports the INTERP1 function."
"Import Data from Within SAS Intelligent Decisioning"
"Important Change: System Options in SAS Studio"
"Importing and Exporting Project Packages"
"Improved Connectivity to Sources"
"Improved text processing and performance enhancements to previously existing features."
"Improved UI Performance."
"Improvements to Autotuning, now highlights champion model"
"Improvements to the OPC-UA Connector and Adapter."
"In a SAS Viya 4 to SAS Viya 4 full-system migration, a restore CronJob now performs the restore."
"In a SAS Viya 4 to SAS Viya 4 multi-tenant migration, you can now migrate from a source environment with internal PostgreSQL to a target environment with external PostgreSQL as long as the source and target use the same cloud provider and SAS Viya version."
"In geographic map objects, you can annotate the map with pins, areas, and routes that are saved with your report. The user interface for the annotations is redesigned to be more intuitive and to provide enhanced capabilities."
"In multi-tenant deployments, the behavior of the sas-tenant-job has changed. During the onboarding of a new tenant, the sas-tenant-job now continues to run until the completion of the rolling restart of all SAS Viya platform services. Successful job completion indicates that a SAS administrator can immediately sign on to the new tenant and begin adding users and groups."
"In previous releases, a Neutral value reported in sentiment analysis could mean that a string contains either a value of no sentiment or a value of mixed positive and negative sentiments. Beginning with this release, a Neutral value means that a string has a balanced mix of positive and negative sentiment values. Strings that have no sentiment value are no longer included in sentiment analysis."
